         The Sword Of The Stranger is a story about a wondering swords man who lend s his skill to help someone out. What makes the end so good is the way the antagonist the bad guy honors his foe and wish to fight him one on one just to test his skills and see if he is better. This is motivating to me because no mater where you are or where you are from there is also someone better than and at the end of the day its best to meet them head on with honor.
